# hello-world

Hello there!

I'm Melanie, but please call me Maia.

I'm into web programming for the time being and I've been a huge fan of videogames and anime/manga since always!

I started my programming path thanks to https://www.freecodecamp.org/ and so far I'm working on Responsive Web Design.

Thanks for reading! 
Maia
